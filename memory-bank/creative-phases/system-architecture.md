# ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design a scalable and maintainable system architecture for the Mock Interview Application that:
1. Supports real-time interview scheduling and updates
2. Handles concurrent users and interviews
3. Ensures data consistency across services
4. Provides reliable authentication and authorization
5. Enables future scalability and feature additions

## OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture with Real-time Extensions
**Description**: Single application with WebSocket integration for real-time features
**Pros**:
- Simpler deployment and maintenance
- Easier development and debugging
- Lower initial complexity
- Single codebase to manage
**Cons**:
- Limited scalability
- All components share resources
- Harder to scale specific features
- Single point of failure
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 2-3 weeks

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture
**Description**: Separate services for different domains with API Gateway
**Pros**:
- Better scalability
- Independent deployment
- Technology flexibility
- Fault isolation
**Cons**:
- Higher complexity
- More infrastructure needed
- Distributed system challenges
- Higher operational overhead
**Complexity**: High
**Implementation Time**: 4-6 weeks

### Option 3: Hybrid Architecture (Selected)
**Description**: Core monolith with microservices for specific features
**Pros**:
- Balanced approach
- Gradual scalability
- Easier initial development
- Flexible service extraction
**Cons**:
- Need to manage both patterns
- Potential technical debt
- More complex deployment
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 3-4 weeks

## DECISION
Selected Option: Hybrid Architecture

Rationale:
1. Provides a good balance between development speed and scalability
2. Allows for gradual service extraction as needed
3. Reduces initial complexity while maintaining flexibility
4. Easier to manage for a small team
5. Can evolve into full microservices if needed

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 1. Core Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Client] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth[Auth Service]
    Gateway --> Core[Core Monolith]
    Gateway --> RealTime[Real-time Service]
    
    Core --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    Core --> Cache[(Redis)]
    
    RealTime --> Cache
    Auth --> Cache
```

### 2. Service Breakdown

#### Core Monolith
- User management
- Profile management
- Interview management
- Points system
- Basic admin features

#### Auth Service
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Session management
- JWT handling

#### Real-time Service
- WebSocket connections
- Interview status updates
- Chat functionality
- Notifications

### 3. Data Flow
```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant G as Gateway
    participant A as Auth
    participant M as Monolith
    participant R as RealTime
    participant D as Database
    participant K as Cache

    C->>G: Request
    G->>A: Validate Token
    A->>K: Check Session
    A->>G: Token Valid
    G->>M: Process Request
    M->>D: Data Operation
    M->>R: Status Update
    R->>K: Cache Update
    R->>C: Real-time Update
```
